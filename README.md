# SAT PDF to CSV

Extract text from SAT question PDFs and use a model-assisted parsing step to produce a reviewable CSV question bank.

**Stack:** Python / Streamlit. **Status:** reference implementation. Provider integrations require your own credentials and service access.

## Run locally

Use Python 3.12 and a virtual environment. Commands below run from the repository root.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock.txt
```

Where the interface asks for a provider key or backend address, supply your own authorized configuration at runtime. The repository does not supply access to an external service.

```bash
python -m streamlit run sat_question_processor.py --server.address 127.0.0.1
```

Open the localhost URL printed by Streamlit. Start with a small synthetic input, review the result, then export or continue the workflow.

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`sat_question_processor.py`](sat_question_processor.py) | Application entrypoint and workflow logic |
| [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) | Direct Python dependencies |
| [`requirements.lock.txt`](requirements.lock.txt) | Pinned Python 3.12 dependencies with integrity hashes |
| [`.github/workflows/repository-quality.yml`](.github/workflows/repository-quality.yml) | Offline maintenance checks |

## Validation

```bash
python .github/scripts/repository_check.py --self-test
python .github/scripts/repository_check.py
```

CI checks Python syntax, local documentation links and credential patterns without importing the app or calling a model. It does not establish grading accuracy or current provider availability. For integration validation, use synthetic examples and compare the output with known answers.

## Operating notes

Model names, remote endpoints and prompt assumptions reflect the original implementation. Review them before connecting current services. Keep provider keys, service-account files and private learning data outside the repository. Any credential previously committed must be rotated; removing it from the current tree does not invalidate earlier copies.

## Contributing

Keep changes focused and add regression coverage for behavior changes. Include synthetic reproduction data and the checks actually run. See the account [contribution guide](https://github.com/shi1720/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [private security reporting process](https://github.com/shi1720/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Refresh dependencies

```bash
uv pip compile --python-version 3.12 --universal --generate-hashes requirements.txt -o requirements.lock.txt
```

Validate the relevant provider integrations before deploying dependency updates. A lockfile fixes dependency resolution; it does not establish that a historical model endpoint is still available.
